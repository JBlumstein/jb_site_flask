	<p>I may have a long commute, but at least it is a good reading commute.

	<p>Why is it a good reading commute? Well, as forementioned, it's long--40 minutes each way. It's also one train, and I usually get a seat for most of it. In eight years of train commutes, I've found that being seated, in one place, for a long time, is the golden combination for getting a lot of reading in.

	<p>Train reading is good reading. Even if someone is saying something insane or someone's bud earphones are leaking the tinny trebble of a hip hop song--both all too frequent occurances on the New York City's A Train--a decent book allows me to drown it out. The rocking of the train or the white noise of the train running over the old rails maybe help me focus. I haven't commuted enough on less rusty rail lines whether this is true or just something I tell myself. 40 minutes is a good amount of time to read at once. It's short enough that if I'm not enjoying what I'm reading I can cut out before getting too bored and long enough to get into it if I'm compelled.

	<p>The best train reading is episodic instead of narrative. Short stories and short essays are not bad. Even better is the type of journalistic non-fiction that links vignettes together into a meta-narrative.

	<p>For me, the journalistic non-fiction I've been reading recently falls into two categories.

	<p>The first is a tour of how we got into this mess. Matthew Desmond's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evicted-Poverty-Profit-American-City/dp/0553447432/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487627648&sr=1-1&keywords=evicted+poverty+and+profit+in+the+american+city">Evicted</a>, an anthropology of the urban housing crisis, and Sam Quinones' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreamland-True-Americas-Opiate-Epidemic/dp/1620402521/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487627741&sr=1-1&keywords=dreamland">Dreamland</a>, a multi-facted look at the spread of heroin and prescription opiates, taught me a lot about how we fell apart as a nation. They're of a piece; to some extent multi-character, multi-arc stories about the ill-fated decisions made by important people and their distributed impacts. It's easy to read them and feel smarter and sadder, but I ultimately don't gain all that much beyond a sort of drawn out form of the anger that I get from reading Twitter each morning. Whatever the intentions of the authors, you can read them and come to the liberals' natural conclusion: that neo-liberalism has led to a situation where selling drugs is profitable but running a capital-intensive business that employs blue-collar workers isn't (or at least isn't profitable compared to running the same business in Mexico or Asia). You can also come to the conservatives' natural conclusion: the corrosion of community foundations like faith have led to a moral decay that lead to bad choices across generations. Of course, neither conclusion excludes the other.

	<p>The second category of journalistic non-fiction I've been reading a lot of lately is about the creation of communities--rather than their destruction--especially pre-internet. Books like Amy Yates Wuelfing and Steven Dilodivico's No Slam Dancing, No Stage Diving, No Spikes (on a Trenton, New Jersey punk rock venue) and Tom Acitelli's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audacity-Hops-History-Americas-Revolution/dp/1613743882">The Audacity of Hops</a> (on the history of the craft brewing movement) are relatively unheralded, but in reading about leaderless efforts to build things it's easy to find yourself in the strange place of rooting for a phenomenon and feeling like you could be in the middle of something similar someday.

	<p>While these books make for great train reading, they're not great reading in general. Journalistic non-fiction, as a genre, tries to mix the fact-finding and -explaining of reporting with the character development of a novel. Trying to do both makes it hard to do either well. I am left with few characters drilled deep into my memory nor a true understanding of the political or cultural issues that led to disaster. Occasionally, a book makes one end work--Evicted has some very remarkable moments and story arcs and Dreamland does a good job of explaining the pipeline of drugs and drug runners from Mexico to the United States--only to fall short on the other.

	<p>Book-length essays make for less natural train reading for me. I've recently enjoyed Kyna Leski's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Storm-Creativity-Simplicity-Technology-Business/dp/0262029944/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487627779&sr=1-1&keywords=the+storm+of+creativity">The Storm of Creativity</a> (on the creative process)--which falls squarely into this cateogry--and William B. Irvine's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487627817&sr=1-1&keywords=a+guide+to+the+good+life+the+ancient+art+of+stoic+joy">A Guide to the Good Life</a> (on stoicism)--which does so to a lesser extent--but I sometimes struggled to remember their main points from train ride to train ride.

	<p>The toughest train reading is fiction and creative non-fiction. However, despite the fact that I read relatively little fiction and creative non-fiction, there is more to savor from these books that have a beating human heart (fictional or non-fictional) at their core. I guess I like a good protagonist. Pnin in Vladimir Nabokov's emigrant novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pnin-Vladimir-Nabokov/dp/0679723412/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487627850&sr=1-1&keywords=pnin+by+vladimir+nabokov">Pnin</a> and David Foster Wallace in David Lipsky's extended interview with the author, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Although-Course-You-Becoming-Yourself/dp/030759243X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487627877&sr=1-1&keywords=although+of+course+you+end+up+becoming+yourself">Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself</a>, count. Not only is it easiest to enjoy the experiences of a character you connect with, it's also easier to learn from them. Pnin's genorisity and DFW's thoughtfulness left me with more than anything else I've read recently. Even sad stories about memorable characters bring more joy than happy ones without a beating heart. But these books require more than 40 minutes at a time sometimes. To understand Pnin's predicament as a man out of place and goodness as a human being reqiures reading longer durations that allow you to know the man. David Foster Wallace and David Lipsky's reporte in Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself is beautiful but processing--who do you agree with and why on the questions posed by Lipsky and turned around by--Wallace require far more than a moment's thought. Sporadic reading in either will reqiure going back for reminders about just what is going on.

	<p>Hence the problem: the easiest reading for me to do is train reading, but the best reading requires greater context and concentration than can be had on a commute-length train ride. Long-term, the solution is clear--read more in my own free time--but for now, with work and social commitments and coursework, I'm left mostly with train reading and the sometimes beautiful, sometimes informative images that can be had there.
