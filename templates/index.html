	<h1>My name is Jonah</h1>
	
	<p>I'm a thinker, tinkerer, reader and do-er in New York, New York. I am a Senior Strategy Consultant in the Corporate Strategy Group at IBM, working on positioning the company in the quickly changing market for enterprise and SME information technology. I previously worked in business development, strategy, and marketing roles at Amazon and Hearst and have an MBA from the NYU Stern School of Business</a>. My skill set includes data analysis (Python, SQL, Excel, basic R) and web design and development (HTML, CSS, Wordpress customization, basic Flask, basic Ruby on Rails). I built this site using Flask in order to try out a new technology.</p>

	<p>I'm fascinated by B2B technology, data science, the future of media, the design of everyday things, and national and New York politics. I'm also a marathoner and "amateur reader" (to quote J.D. Salinger), with the music taste of a 35-year-old ex-punk.</p>
