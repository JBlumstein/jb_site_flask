	<p>Over the past year, there's been an ongoing discussion in tech circles about the emergence of workable news media models. With many players&mdash;including Vox, BuzzFeed, and Mic&mdash;raising venture capital in 2014, news media is emerging as a locus of attention.</p>

	<p>For those of us who love journalism, this development should be cheered. However, product deficiencies still abound. They are the result of a business model problem: display advertising and programmatic content discovery is such a bad business&mdash;and one that's only getting worse with increasing supply and dropping CPM&mdash;that the compromises necessary to hit revenue goals lead to a lack of customer focus and a degradation of the reading experience.</p>

	<h3>The Bad News</h3>

	<p>Here are the problems that result from business models based on display advertising and programmatic content discovery:</p><ul><li><strong>Terrible user experience</strong>: Ads, ads everywhere! Some of the worst offenders are legacy media, which have a tendency to lard up their online properties with display ads in order to squeeze out every ounce of value in order to make up for dropping print ad revenues. These display ads clutter the page design and slow down load times.</li><li><strong>Manipulative headlines</strong>: The constant chase for traffic to maximize display ad views leads news sites to do anything to get eyeballs on the page, even if it means essentially lying to readers. Readers are already getting sick of the curiosity gap and oversold headlines in general&mdash;notice that BuzzFeed, the leader of the new breed of online news properties, undersells rather than oversells its stories.</li><li><strong>Broken content discovery</strong>: A lot of content discovery on news websites is determined programmatically by third parties and the results are curated in a scattershot way, if at all. The result is that "Best from the web" article suggestions that are simply junk&mdash;the articles peddled are about as highly regarded by readers as the average display ad.</li><li><strong>Bad journalism</strong>: Incumbents and newer players alike are publishing misinformation at a frightening clip; in a 24/7 media where page views are everything, content is found almost entirely through social media, and brand means nothing, there is no incentive to check facts. Reporters are all-too-often proving themselves uninformed, innumerate, and/or overly credulous, leading to stories that bury the lede, manipulate data inappropriately, or are flat-out wrong. In a world where stories spread at a rate unheard of in the pre-social media era, publishers have even greater responsibility to get the facts right.</li></ul>

	<h3>The Good News</h3>

	<p>Interestingly, native and content advertising may solve all of the above problems, largely because it may end the reign of excessive display advertising. Eschewing display advertising speeds up page load times and allows for cleaner, more reader-friendly designs. It also eliminates the direct incentive to chase traffic at the cost of pulling a bait-and-switch to get readers to your website or possibly getting a story wrong.</p>

	<p>Native and content advertising is also a more lucrative business than display advertising or content discovery, at least currently. Native and content advertising may allow news media companies to accrue the revenue neccesary to invest in a high-end product, featuring a custom CMS, quality design work, and original stories by talented writers and editors.</p>

	<p>Notably, Vox, BuzzFeed, and Mic&mdash;category leaders mentioned at the start of this piece&mdash;all rely heavily on native and content advertising. BuzzFeed and Mic are free of display ads. Although Mic does do content swaps&mdash;content discovery deals made directly between publications&mdash;they're thoughtfully curated and on-brand.</p>

	<p>Native and content advertising do come with their own costs, including an investment in data analysis and branded content creation and the potential for PR disasters by taking on the "wrong" clients (see, e.g., the Atlantic's native advertisement for the Church of Scientology). However, the near-term future is clear: native and content advertising is the direction the new news media is going, and it's a positive development for publishers and readers alike.</p>
